# Shen_PNAS_2021 Source Data and Figure Script

## **Source data and Figure Script (in Matlab) for the following paper: A synergy between mechanosensitive calcium- and membrane binding mediates tension-sensing by C2-like domains (DOI: 10.1073/pnas.2112390119)**

## General Guidelines
- Source Data is stored in **Shen_PNAS_2021_Source_Data.mat**(Can be opened using Matlab) 

- Figure Script is divided according to figure number referenced in the paper and names of all figure scripts start with "Figure" (For example, the script that generates Figure 1 is stored in Figure1.mat).

- Other files are auxillary functions for Figure Script.

**Note: All files/scripts should be kept in the same directory, otherwise Matlab program will not recognize auxillary functions while running Figure Script.**
